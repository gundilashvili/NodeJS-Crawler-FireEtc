A multi-purpose leather boot that is NFPA certified, you have the convenience of three boots in one. Wear it in the station, on EMS calls, to wildland brush fires, and Urban Search and Rescue deployments.Anatomically constructed and built with a lightweight composite toe, HAIX® Airpower XR1 Pro boots give your feet plenty of room to move around while protecting them from toe impact and compression because there is nothing worse than a protective toe that pinches or restricts your movement. The added profiled rubber toe bumper keeps the toe area protected from cuts, scrapes and abrasions that could damage the leather.Built in Arch SupportThe HAIX® Airpower XR1 Pro's built-in arch support provides much needed support to the arch, which takes the brunt of the pressure when standing. Proper support of the arch helps to prevent foot pain when on your feet all day and possible foot problems later on. And the newly design ladder shank on the inside offers the maximum amount of support to the sensitive arch area when on ladder rungs. And with the laced in zipper system, any firefighter can adjust the lacing for a more personal fit while enjoying the benefits of a quick in and out boot. Because on the job, seconds matter. Waterproof and Sun Reflect technologyThe HAIX® Airpower XR1 Pro is both waterproof and breathable with the added benefit of chemical and bloodborne pathogen protection. Working in tandem with the HAIX® climate system, your feet will stay dry, comfortable, and protected, thanks to these leather rescue and wildland boots – even in times of extended exposure to water. The upper material of these European leather EMS and USAR boots uses Sun Reflect technology, which reduces the solar heating effect and keeps feet cooler by reflecting the sun’s rays. Slip Resistant Soles and Quick Drying InsolesThe soles of the HAIX® Airpower XR1 Pro are extremely slip resistant which offers an effective grip when exposed to water and oil. So even when you’re on a rescue and you need to move fast, these leather rescue boots will be able to keep you on your feet. The cushioned insole offers the ultimate in comfort, especially when combined with the built-in arch support.The insoles are anatomically formed to deliver a perfect fit and are made to provide excellent moisture absorption and as well as quick drying qualities. When your insoles get completely dirty after long days on duty, all you need to do is throw then in the wash, air dry, and they’ll be ready the next day’s work.Secura Liner® and CROSSTECH® Protected.Secura Liner® guarantees that your HAIX EMS rescue boot’s liner will never pull out or wrinkle over time. The CROSSTECH® liner also ensures that the gear is comfortable and safe against blood, chemicals, and body fluids.Engineered in GermanyEMS Boots Tri-Certified for EMS, Wildland, and USARSecura Liner® – will never wrinkle up or pull out over timeCROSSTECH® inner liner, waterproof, breathable, bacteria, chemical, and bloodborne pathogen resistantHAIX® Sun Reflect leather keeps feet cooler in direct sunlightHAIX® Arch Support System supports your foot in its natural, ideal positionHAIX® Climate System for temperature balanceHAIX® Lacing System offers the entry and exit of a zipper boot with the personal fit of a lace up bootCarbon protective toe cap and exterior rubber toe capPuncture protection soleOil Resistant BootsHeat resistant rubber soleASTM certified for electrical hazard resistance (EH Rated)ype a description for this product here...","https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-49x4nwiz/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/938/1906/XR1_Pro_A__13975.1643227473.jpg?c=2, https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-49x4nwiz/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/938/1907/XR1PRO_b__10073.1643227477.jpg?c=2, https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-49x4nwiz/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/938/1908/XR1_PRO_c__39739.1643227479.jpg?c=2, https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-49x4nwiz/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/938/1909/XR1_PRO_d__59938.1643227481.jpg?c=2, ","86bdd379-d76d-4108-95d4-77bbb3a959ab.png, 6851eade-c218-4193-966c-9ef07cf0e32f.png, cc041561-eae5-4f7d-93fa-d6f205efa74b.png, 62a0ada8-77e2-4894-8167-050af396304c.png, ",https://www.fire-etc.com/haix-airpower-xr1-pro-dual-certified-wildland-boots/

You need a boot that can match the challenges you face, that is as tough as you are. The new Missoula 2.1 fire boots are up to that task and more and are certified NFPA 1977 for wildland firefighting.The HAIX® Missoula 2.1 NFPA hiking boots for wildland firefighting were built to meet the exacting demands of the wildland firefighter. The durably tough European split bull leather is water-resistant, hydrophobic and breathable to keep your feet as comfortable as possible. The lighter weight of the Missoula 2.1 helps to alleviate leg fatigue while on long hikes, since the less weight you have on your feet, the less energy you have to expend while walking. Offering not only safety protection, but comfort, for those who can spend all day on their feet in the most rugged of terrain.Our newly designed highly heat-resistant, Vibram®, anti-slip sole will give you greater footholds on whatever terrain you have to face. The special design of the heel offers strong footholds on even the most steep and uneven terrain. And the sturdy and stable midsole ensures you won’t feel every rock and stone as you hike. We also added a built-in boot jack at the rear of the boot to make it easier for you to get your boots off after a long day.Our two-zone lacing system allows you to adjust the tension separately on different sections of the boot, the upper and the lower part. You are able to adjust the HAIX wildland boots for a fit tailored just for you and the terrain in which you are hiking. For mainly downward descents, tighten the upper and the lowers evenly to prevent your foot from sliding forward into the boot. For mainly upward ascents, leave the upper a little looser so the upper does not constrict your shin. The two-zone lacing also provides better ankle support to prevent potential ankle injuries out on the line. The new roller ball eyelets on the lower part of the lacing system offers minimal friction, reducing wear and tear on the flame-resistant Nomex® laces.Missoula 2.1 NFPA hiking boots for wildland firefighting are available in narrow, medium, and wide widths with whole and half sizes from 4 to 13.Now’s the time to try out the latest generation Missoula 2.1, see and feel the difference.Certified NFPA 1977-2016Certified ASTM F2892-2018 for Electrical Hazard resistanceSecura Liner® – will never wrinkle up or pull out over timeHAIX® 2-Zone Lacing - Ankle lace lock allows independent lace adjustment between the upper and lower boot.HAIX® ES Out System for easier removal of bootHeel grip for superior hold on steep terrainRugged Vibram® heat-resistant sole with side stabilization specifically designed for hikingSole is fuel and oil-resistant and heat resistant to 572°FWater-resistant, breathable leatherNomex® threads and laces8 inches","https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-49x4nwiz/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/939/1918/111011_missoula_2-1b__54932.1650582982.jpg?c=2, https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-49x4nwiz/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/939/1919/Missoula_2-1-right2c__79931.1650582985.jpg?c=2, https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-49x4nwiz/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/939/1920/Missoula_2-1-back2__42408.1650582987.jpg?c=2, https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-49x4nwiz/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/939/1921/Missoula_2-1-left__69979.1650582988.jpg?c=2, https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-49x4nwiz/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/939/1922/Missoula_2-1-front__38668.1650582990.jpg?c=2, https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-49x4nwiz/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/939/1924/Missoula_2-1_sole__61079.1650582995.jpg?c=2, https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-49x4nwiz/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/939/1925/2-zone-lacing-2017__78408.1650582997.gif?c=2, https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-49x4nwiz/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/939/1926/easy-slip-out-system-2017_200x200__50776.1650582999.gif?c=2, ","b32a9283-65ae-4301-9337-41262bf41439.png, e797108b-4622-439b-8fce-7e07c7830ae9.png, dd86fe78-59fb-4f24-8e38-2bc3e7877513.png, cd6c0848-5915-4553-9c7f-c1411c5d4455.png, 919e0c06-cd89-4d99-a77d-aad29b76ffad.png, 9cfe3071-1af5-4984-8141-0fa68ee3877e.png, f3dd3db5-a4fe-4d44-ac74-d55de77a1ca6.png, 3629c0e5-7ba2-4721-8c5d-91febfc3ffdd.png, ",https://www.fire-etc.com/haix-missoula-2-1-nfpa-wildland-boot/

The high efficient P100 together with pre filter and spark arrester protects against all types of particles, sparks, and ash particulates. Greater Comfort and Less Breathing Resistance Our flexible Silicone mask fits great. Sundstrom's unique design significantly cuts inhalation and exhalation resistance making the mask twice as easy to breathe through. This increases comfort and lengthens use time. 250% More Air Flow Our half mask respirator and P100 filter allows breathing rates of more than 250 liters per minute as compared to most competitive products which generally allow only 95 lpm. This means the Sundstrom user can handle much heavier work loads. Far Less Cost Over Time The SR 100 is an easy to maintain, clean and disinfect reusable mask. Our distinct pre-filter system together with spark arrester prevents premature clogging of the particulate filter and protects the P100 against sparks and ash particulates.
